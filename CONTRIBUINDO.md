## Antes de começar

Agradeço pelo seu interese em participar. Será uma honra contar com sua ajuda e contribuição nesse projeto.

# Como contribuir

Se você quiser participar, entre em contato nos enviando um e-mail com o assunto "PROJETO OPEN-SOURCE" e exponha os seus motivos em querer fazer parte dessa comunidade.

Observe que temos um [Código de Conduta](CODIGO-DE-CONDUTA.md), siga-o em todas as suas interações com o projeto.

## Começando

> Here you should address guidelines about future functionalities, milestone labels, bugs and unlisted features, issued assignments, etc. Since now we have an `Issue` and a `Pull Request` template, you can reference them directly:

For further guidance about getting started, please refer to the related links:

* [Pull Request Guidelines](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* [Issues Guidelines](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)

> **ProTip:** It's important people know the rules for contributing in the project. It's irritating for people trying to help when they are pushed back because they didn't follow some process that they didn't know existed. This file is the place for these processes and it will lower the barrier to entry for contribution.

## Coding conventions

> Code should be optimized for readability. Attach some custom style guide or reference some. i.e.:

In order to sanitize coding standards, please follow [this style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Code of Conduct

> This section should explicitly state that we will not discriminate against people on any grounds other than their code contributions, and make clear that behaviour that would be harmful to other people that may wish to contribute is not acceptable. This gives clear authority to remove people who are causing problems, and also sets a clear tone of inclusion.

> **ProTip:** You can find more about  [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) or as a seperate `code_of_conduct` file. [Good sample](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).
